## User Preferences

### Development Workflow
- **No automatic retries**: Never add retry logic or error recovery mechanisms without explicit permission from the user
- **Fail fast**: Let tests and commands fail immediately so issues are visible and can be properly diagnosed
- **Explicit control**: User prefers to handle failures manually rather than having automated workarounds

## Project Context
- Rails 8 application with comprehensive CI/CD pipeline
- System tests can have intermittent timing issues but should fail visibly when they occur
- bin/go script runs full development pipeline including unit tests, system tests, security scans, and code quality checks
