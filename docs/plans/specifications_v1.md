# Application Specifications v1
## Friends

I should be able to invite friends to my Playlists. 

Friends can accept or archive the invite.
Friends can leave playlists if they want.

Friends can view an activity and express their interest on a scale of 1 though 5.

Everyone who can view the Playlist should be called a Playlist Watcher.

## Coordinating Activities

The application should have an Activity Coordinator module.

This module should suggest activites based on the Playlist Watchers: 
- interest in the events
- recency of last participated

Users should be able to trigger a command for the application to review their Google Calendar and Sidewalk Playlists, and suggest Activities to populate empty days (up to 4 weekends into the future).

Coordinator should not suggest more than 3 Activities per day.

Activities should be ranked
