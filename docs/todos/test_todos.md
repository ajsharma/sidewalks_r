# Test Coverage TODO Items

This document tracks code that is difficult to test or would require low-level infrastructure testing that doesn't provide meaningful value.

## Items Excluded from Coverage Requirements

### 1. ActivitySchedulingController #create
**File**: `app/controllers/activity_scheduling_controller.rb`
**Lines**: Complex Google Calendar API interactions
**Reason**: Requires external API mocking that's better handled with integration tests. The service layer should be tested separately.

### 2. Devise Configuration
**File**: Various Devise-generated code
**Reason**: Third-party library code that's thoroughly tested by the gem maintainers.

### 3. OAuth Callback Handling
**File**: OAuth-related controller methods
**Reason**: Complex external service interactions that require significant test infrastructure. Better covered by end-to-end tests.

### 4. ActiveRecord Callbacks in Edge Cases
**File**: Various model callback chains
**Reason**: Some callback combinations are only triggered in specific production scenarios that are difficult to simulate.

### 5. Error Handling for External Services
**File**: Google Calendar API error handling
**Reason**: Network-dependent error scenarios that are better tested with integration tests.

## Issues to Fix

### Activity Controller Test Failures
- Activity destroy test failing due to fixture state conflicts
- Need to investigate test isolation issues

### Current Coverage Status
As of the latest test run, we have **85.3% coverage (592/694 lines)**.

**Previous Target**: 58% minimum coverage ✅ **ACHIEVED**
**Current Target**: 85% coverage ✅ **ACHIEVED**
**Next Goal**: Maintain 85%+ coverage with continued development

## Coverage Analysis - ✅ COMPLETED
