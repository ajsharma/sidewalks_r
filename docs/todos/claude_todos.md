- [x] Create base Activity model with scheduling capabilities
- [x] Create Playlist model
- [x] Create PlaylistActivity join model
- [x] Set up proper database migrations with indexes and comments
- [x] Implement soft delete pattern (archived_at)
- [x] Generate Devise views for authentication

## Phase 2: Google Calendar Integration âœ… COMPLETE
- [x] Add Google Calendar gems to Gemfile (google-apis-calendar_v3, omniauth-google-oauth2)
- [x] Set up Google OAuth credentials in Rails credentials
- [x] Create GoogleAccount model for secure token storage with encryption
- [x] Implement OAuth flow for Google Calendar access (Users::OmniauthCallbacksController)
- [x] Build Google Calendar API service classes (GoogleCalendarService)
- [x] Create calendar event CRUD operations (create_event, update_event, delete_event, list_events)
- [x] Set up Active Record encryption for OAuth tokens
- [x] Implement idempotent token refresh mechanism
- [x] Support multiple Google calendars per user
- [x] **TEST RESULTS**: Successfully fetched 4 calendars and created test event

### Phase 2 Achievements:
- **OAuth Flow**: Working end-to-end with real Google credentials
- **Token Security**: Encrypted storage with automatic refresh
- **API Integration**: Full CRUD operations on Google Calendar
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and graceful failures
- **Calendar Access**: Primary calendar (aj@ajsharma.com) + 3 additional calendars

## Phase 3: Core Activity System âœ… COMPLETE
- [x] Activities controller with full CRUD
- [x] Activity scheduling system (strict vs flexible times)
- [x] Activity expiration/deadline handling
- [x] Max frequency options implementation
- [x] Playlists controller with full CRUD
- [x] Activity-Playlist association management
- [x] RESTful routes and proper authorization
- [x] Basic UI/forms for activity and playlist management

## Phase 4: Activity Coordinator âœ… COMPLETE
- [x] Coordinator algorithm for activity suggestions
- [x] Calendar gap analysis (empty days using list_events)
- [x] Interest and recency-based recommendations
- [x] Max 3 activities per day constraint
- [x] 4-weekend lookahead window
- [x] Respect max frequency settings
- [x] Integration with GoogleCalendarService for event creation

## Phase 5: Enterprise CI/CD & Code Quality âœ… COMPLETE (NEW)
- [x] SimpleCov code coverage integration with 80% minimum threshold
- [x] Enhanced CI pipeline with coverage validation
- [x] Bundle Audit for Ruby gem security scanning
- [x] Strong Migrations for safer database changes
- [x] Reek code smell detection (0 violations)
- [x] Rails Best Practices analysis (clean)
- [x] RuboCop styling and linting (91 files, no offenses)
- [x] Brakeman security vulnerability scanning
- [x] Parallel CI job execution for optimal performance
- [x] Accessibility testing foundation (axe-core-capybara ready)

## Technical Architecture (Current State)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with proper indexes and foreign keys
- **Security**: Rails encrypted credentials + Active Record encryption for tokens
- **Authentication**: Devise with Google OAuth (scope: email, profile, calendar)
- **API Service**: GoogleCalendarService handles all calendar operations
- **Testing**: 87.66% code coverage with comprehensive test suite
- **CI/CD**: Enterprise-grade GitHub Actions pipeline with security scanning
- **Code Quality**: Zero violations across all static analysis tools
- **Documentation**: Google OAuth setup guide in docs/setup/google_oauth.md

## ðŸš€ Production Ready Status
**All core functionality is COMPLETE and ready for production deployment:**

### âœ… Core Features Implemented
- **Activity Management**: Full CRUD with strict/flexible/deadline scheduling
- **Playlist System**: Activity organization and management
- **Google Calendar Integration**: Bi-directional sync with conflict detection
- **Activity Coordinator**: Intelligent scheduling algorithm with user preferences
- **Authentication**: Secure OAuth flow with encrypted token storage

### âœ… Quality Assurance
- **Test Coverage**: 87.66% (exceeds industry standard of 80%)
- **Security Scanning**: Brakeman + Bundle Audit + Importmap audit
- **Code Quality**: Reek (0 warnings) + Rails Best Practices (clean)
- **Style Consistency**: RuboCop (91 files, no offenses)
- **Database Safety**: Strong Migrations preventing unsafe changes

### âœ… Recent Achievements (October 2025)
- **PR #26**: SimpleCov coverage validation in CI pipeline
- **PR #27**: Enhanced static analysis and accessibility foundation
- **Enterprise CI/CD**: Parallel job execution with comprehensive quality gates
- **Code Excellence**: Achieved zero violations across all quality tools

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Opportunities (Staff Engineering Level)
Based on current production-ready state, next improvements could focus on:

1. **Performance & Scalability**
   - Database indexing optimization
   - Redis caching strategy
   - Background job optimization
