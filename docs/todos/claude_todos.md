- [x] Foundation models created ✅
- [x] Google Calendar integration implemented ✅
- [ ] Core activity system built (controllers/views)
- [ ] Activity coordinator implemented

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Set up User authentication (Devise)
- [x] Create development seed user (user@sidewalkshq.com / sidewalks)
- [x] Create base Activity model with scheduling capabilities
- [x] Create Playlist model
- [x] Create PlaylistActivity join model
- [x] Set up proper database migrations with indexes and comments
- [x] Implement soft delete pattern (archived_at)
- [x] Generate Devise views for authentication

## Phase 2: Google Calendar Integration ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Add Google Calendar gems to Gemfile (google-apis-calendar_v3, omniauth-google-oauth2)
- [x] Set up Google OAuth credentials in Rails credentials
- [x] Create GoogleAccount model for secure token storage with encryption
- [x] Implement OAuth flow for Google Calendar access (Users::OmniauthCallbacksController)
- [x] Build Google Calendar API service classes (GoogleCalendarService)
- [x] Create calendar event CRUD operations (create_event, update_event, delete_event, list_events)
- [x] Set up Active Record encryption for OAuth tokens
- [x] Implement idempotent token refresh mechanism
- [x] Support multiple Google calendars per user
- [x] **TEST RESULTS**: Successfully fetched 4 calendars and created test event

### Phase 2 Achievements:
- **OAuth Flow**: Working end-to-end with real Google credentials
- **Token Security**: Encrypted storage with automatic refresh
- **API Integration**: Full CRUD operations on Google Calendar
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and graceful failures
- **Calendar Access**: Primary calendar (aj@ajsharma.com) + 3 additional calendars

## Phase 3: Core Activity System (Next Priority)
- [ ] Activities controller with full CRUD
- [ ] Activity scheduling system (strict vs flexible times)
- [ ] Activity expiration/deadline handling
- [ ] Max frequency options implementation
- [ ] Playlists controller with full CRUD
- [ ] Activity-Playlist association management
- [ ] RESTful routes and proper authorization
- [ ] Basic UI/forms for activity and playlist management

## Phase 4: Activity Coordinator (Future)
- [ ] Coordinator algorithm for activity suggestions
- [ ] Calendar gap analysis (empty days using list_events)
- [ ] Interest and recency-based recommendations
- [ ] Max 3 activities per day constraint
- [ ] 4-weekend lookahead window
- [ ] Respect max frequency settings
- [ ] Integration with GoogleCalendarService for event creation

## Technical Notes
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with proper indexes and foreign keys
- **Security**: Rails encrypted credentials + Active Record encryption for tokens
- **Authentication**: Devise with Google OAuth (scope: email, profile, calendar)
- **API Service**: GoogleCalendarService handles all calendar operations
- **Testing**: Verified with real Google account integration
- **Documentation**: Google OAuth setup guide in docs/setup/google_oauth.md

## Ready for Implementation
The foundation is complete for building the Activity Coordinator. All Google Calendar
integration is working and ready to support:
- Finding empty calendar slots
- Creating events from activity suggestions
- Managing multiple calendars per user
- Secure token management and refresh
